The specific mapping (e.g., which string corresponds to 0, which to 1) depends on the alphabetical order of the unique categories encountered during the `LabelEncoder.fit()` process for each respective column. Without direct access to the `classes_` attribute of the `LabelEncoder` instance used for each individual column (as the `le` object was overwritten for each column), the exact string-to-integer mapping cannot be explicitly stated here, but the numerical representation implies this sequential integer assignment."

        "For the hypothetical patient, the model predicted **Dead** (encoded as `1`). Let's consider how the user-provided values for the key features might have contributed to this prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Survival Months** (`15`): This is a relatively low number of survival months. Since a lower number of survival months generally indicates a poorer prognosis, this value likely played a significant role in the 'Dead' prediction.\n",
        "*   **Age** (`53`): Age is a significant factor in breast cancer prognosis, though its impact can be complex. In this case, 53 is a middle age, which alone might not strongly push towards one outcome, but it contributes to the overall risk profile.\n",
        "*   **Tumor Size** (`23`): Tumor size is a critical prognostic factor. Larger tumor sizes are generally associated with a worse prognosis. A tumor size of `23` (likely in mm, based on typical medical units) could be considered moderately large, contributing to the 'Dead' prediction.\n",
        "*   **Regional Node Examined** (`1`): The number of regional lymph nodes examined. A very low number examined might not provide comprehensive staging information, or if only a few were examined and some were positive, it points to spread.\n",
        "*   **Reginol Node Positive** (`1`): This indicates that at least one regional lymph node was found to be positive. Lymph node involvement (especially positive nodes) is a very strong indicator of cancer spread and a significant predictor of a poorer prognosis. The presence of positive regional nodes for the hypothetical patient likely contributed substantially to the 'Dead' prediction.\n",
        "*   **Other Categorical Features** (e.g., Marital Status, T Stage, N Stage, 6th Stage, Grade, A Stage, Estrogen Status, Progesterone Status): While individually less impactful than the top numerical features, the specific combination of these encoded values for the hypothetical patient (e.g., `T Stage: 4` (T2), `N Stage: 1` (N1), `6th Stage: 4` (IV), `Grade: 0` (Anaplastic/Grade IV), `A Stage: 1` (Distant), `Estrogen Status: 0` (Negative), `Progesterone Status: 0` (Negative)) collectively paints a picture of advanced disease characteristics (Stage IV, Anaplastic grade, Distant metastasis, ER/PR negative which are often more aggressive) which strongly aligns with a 'Dead' prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the model's prediction of 'Dead' for this hypothetical patient is highly influenced by the combination of relatively low **Survival Months**, the presence of **Reginol Node Positive** cancer, a notable **Tumor Size**, and the aggregated unfavorable characteristics from the categorical features like the `6th Stage` and `A Stage` indicating distant metastasis, and `Estrogen/Progesterone Status` being negative, which often signifies a more aggressive tumor type."

        "*   **Feature Importance:** The most influential factors in predicting breast cancer status were `Survival Months` (0.3866), `Age` (0.1171), `Tumor Size` (0.1036), `Regional Node Examined` (0.0985), and `Reginol Node Positive` (0.0792).\n",
        "*   **Data Preprocessing:** An irrelevant column, 'Unnamed: 3', was identified (with 0.0000 importance) and successfully removed from the dataset, ensuring a cleaner feature set for modeling.\n",
        "*   **Feature Representation:** Features were categorized into numerical (e.g., `Survival Months`, `Age`, `Tumor Size`) and label-encoded categorical (e.g., `Marital Status`, `6th Stage`, `Race`, `Grade`). The numerical representation of categorical features (e.g., 0 for Divorced, 1 for Married for `Marital Status`) was clarified for user input.\n",
        "*   **Hypothetical Patient Prediction:** A `RandomForestClassifier` model predicted a status of \"Dead\" for a hypothetical patient profile.\n",
        "*   **Prediction Drivers:** This prediction was primarily driven by:\n",
        "    *   A relatively low `Survival Months` value (15).\n",
        "    *   The presence of `Reginol Node Positive` (1), indicating lymph node involvement.\n",
        "    *   A notable `Tumor Size` (23).\n",
        "    *   Aggregated unfavorable characteristics from categorical features, including `6th Stage: 4` (Stage IV), `A Stage: 1` (Distant metastasis), and `Estrogen Status: 0` (Negative) and `Progesterone Status: 0` (Negative), which often signify a more aggressive tumor type.\n",
